Now we can grab elements directly from GEL Generic. 

GEL Genric wraps up React Bootstrap with our GBST branded styles. So for any documentation the best place to look is [https://react-bootstrap.github.io](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts)

In going straight to React Boostrap we simply by decoupling any tightly coupled logic and validation and we improve performance by removing a dependency. 

### What we'll build:
1. ProductWell
2. AdvisorWell
3. PersonalDetailsWell
4. ExampleTable
5. SummaryWell
