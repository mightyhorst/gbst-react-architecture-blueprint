# ðŸ–– LogicKit

The LogicKit performs the following goals:
* State Management 
* Form validation 
* API integration
* Authn/Authz
* Auth Guards with Functional Groups 
* Routing 


The LogicKit acheieves these with the use of three key repeatable and scalable patterns
1. Provider Pattern
2. Reducer Pattern
3. Hooks Composition Pattern  

## ðŸ–– 1. Provider Pattern

The Provider pattern performs 2 primary purposes: 
1.1. share state across multiple Components (without props drilling) 
1.2. inject actions into multiple components - similar to how an IoC container would use dependency injection

It may be helpful to think of this as similar to the role of an AngularJs controller in sharing scope, and actions.

# ðŸ–– 2. Reducer Pattern 
What should the Provider Pattern inject? 
The simplest way to build a scalable state machine (similar to the DAL) is to use recers
